Introduction
============

Pasteup is where design meets development. It is where the Guardianâ€™s globally recognised design language is turned into code for the web, and the starting point when styling Guardian branded products for both internal teams and third parties.

**Why Pasteup?** It's a newspaper term for "the assemblage of pages by pasting type onto page mockups, which are then photographed to be made into metal plates for the printing press" (courtesy of John E McIntyre). This is quite a nice metaphor for how client-side development builds the Guardian's pages. Plus it sounds cool.

Getting started
---------------

    > ./setup.sh      # Installs build/server dependencies, including nodejs and npm.
    > cd build
    > node server.js  # Starts server on http://localhost:3000

You should now be able to reach the docs homepage at http://localhost:3000/docs/index.html. Any changes you make in the `/less`, `/js`, or `/content` directories will trigger a full build, and immediatley be available for viewing on localhost.

LESS
----

Pasteup uses LESS to build and minify CSS. Sometimes, if you ask nicely you can use a CSS variable - or maybe even a mixin.

RequireJS
---------

Pasteup uses RequireJS and the AMD pattern to split JavaScript into modules, along with the built in optimizer to build production versions of these modules.
